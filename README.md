# Machine Learing Tensorflow
This is a Google Colab notebook for predicting housing prices using a TensorFlow-based machine learning model. In this project, we'll demonstrate how to:

- Load and preprocess the housing dataset.
- Build and train a neural network model using TensorFlow.
- Evaluate the model's performance.
- Make predictions on new data.
